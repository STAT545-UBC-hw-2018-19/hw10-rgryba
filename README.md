# HW10 - Web scraping
## Rowenna Gryba

=============

For this homework task I used `rvest` and `httr` to do webscraping from the eBirds website located [here](https://ebird.org/home).

I have created two Rmd files that include my code and examples from the tables created. The tables resulting from the web scraping are also saved as .csv. 

Please look at the `rvest` method first.

The files can be found here:

|Method|Rmd|csv files|
|---|---|---|
|rvest|[rvestRmd](web_scraping_rvest.Rmd)|[taxSplit](splitCombo.csv), [AKbirds](eBirdsAKobsDate)|
|httr|[httrRmd](web_scraping_api.Rmd)|[taxaList](eBirdsTax.csv), [AKsightings](eBirdsAlaskaSpDate.csv)
